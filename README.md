The user will then determine their ability scores, decription of the character, and chose their equipment.
The user will have the ability to update the equipment or stats and be able to create or delete mulitple characters.
Admin will be able to see all the users and their characters, will also have the ability to add or delete users or characters.
All updates will be seen on the mobile version and website.
